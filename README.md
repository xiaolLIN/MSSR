# MSSR
The source code for our WSDM '24 paper [**"Multi-Sequence Attentive User Representation Learning for Side-information Integrated Sequential Recommendation"**]



## Preparation
We train and evaluate our MSSR using a Tesla V100 PCIe GPU with 32 GB memory, where the CUDA version is 11.2. <br>
Our code is based on PyTorch, and requires the following python packages:

> + numpy==1.21.6
> + scipy==1.7.3 
> + torch==1.13.1+cu116
> + tensorboard==2.11.2


## Usage

Due to file size limitation, we only provide two datasets, Beauty `./dataset/Amazon_Beauty` and Toys `./dataset/Amazon_Toys_and_Games`.  <br>
Please download the other two datasets from [RecSysDatasets](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecSysDatasets) or their [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ahiLmzU7cGRPXf5qGMqtAChte2eYp9gI). And put the files in `./dataset/` like the following.

```

└── yelp

```

Run `run_MSSR.sh`. After training and evaluation, check out the final metrics in the "result.txt".
